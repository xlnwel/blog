## Introduction

We show that the recent formulation introduced by Al-Shedivat et al. (2018) and Stadie et al. (2018) leads to poor credit assignment, while the MAML formulation (Finn et al., 2017) potentially yields superior meta-policy updates. Second, based on insights from our formal analysis, we highlight both the importance and difﬁculty of proper meta-policy gradient estimates. In light of this, we propose the low variance curvature (LVC) surrogate objective which yields gradient estimates with a favorable bias-variance trade-off. Finally, building upon the LVC estimator we develop Proximal MetaPolicy Search (ProMP), an efﬁcient and stable meta-learning algorithm for RL. (excerpted from the Rothfuss, Lee&Clavera et al.[1])

## Sampling Distribution Credit Assignment

Finn et al. proposed the objective of MAML-RL as follows

$$
J^I(\theta)=\mathbb E_{\mathcal T\sim\rho(\mathcal T)}\left[\mathbb E_{\tau'\sim P_{\mathcal T}(\tau'|\theta')}\left[R(\tau')\right]\right]\tag{1}\label{eq:1}\\\
where\quad\theta':=U(\theta,\mathcal T)=\theta+\alpha\nabla_\theta\mathbb E_{\tau\sim P_{\mathcal T}(\tau|\theta)}[R(\tau)]
$$

Al-Shedivat et al. and Stadie et al. proposed the following objective

$$
J^{II}(\theta)=\mathbb E_{\mathcal T\sim\rho(\mathcal T)}\left[\mathbb E_{\tau\sim P(\tau|\theta)\\\\tau'\sim P_{\mathcal T}(\tau'|\theta')}\left[R(\tau')\right]\right]\tag{2}\label{eq:2}\\\
where\quad\theta':=U(\theta,\tau)=\theta+\alpha\nabla_\theta R(\tau)
$$

The difference is that $$J^{II}(\theta)$$  moves the expectation over $$\tau$$ out of function $$U$$ in $$J^I(\theta)$$. This impact becomes clearer when we compute their gradients. Going through the math, we can compute the gradient of $$J^{I}(\theta)$$ as follows

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\theta}J^I(\theta)=\mathbb E_{\mathcal T\sim\rho(\mathcal T)}\Bigg[
\mathbb E_{\tau\sim P(\tau|\theta)\\\\tau'\sim P_{\mathcal T}(\tau'|\theta')}
\bigg[\underbrace{
\big(I+R(\tau)\alpha\nabla_\theta^2\log\pi_{\theta}(\tau)\big)\nabla_{\theta'}\log\pi_\theta(\tau')R(\tau')}_{\nabla_\theta J_{post}(\tau,\tau')}\\\
+\underbrace{\alpha\nabla_\theta\log\pi_\theta(\tau)\Big(\underbrace{(\nabla_\theta\log\pi_\theta R(\tau))^T}_{\nabla_\theta J^{inner}}\underbrace{(\nabla_{\theta'}\log\pi_{\theta'}(\tau')R(\tau')}_{\nabla_{\theta'} J^{outer}})\Big)}_{\nabla_\theta J^I_{pre}(\tau,\tau')}\bigg]\Bigg]\tag{3}\label{eq:3}
\end{align}
$$

and the gradient of $$J^{II}(\theta)$$ as follows

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\theta}J^{II}(\theta)=\mathbb E_{\mathcal T\sim\rho(\mathcal T)}
\Bigg[\mathbb E_{\tau\sim P(\tau|\theta)\\\\tau'\sim P_{\mathcal T}(\tau'|\theta')}
\Big[&
\underbrace{
\big(I+R(\tau)\alpha\nabla_\theta^2\log\pi_{\theta}(\tau)\big)\nabla_{\theta'}\log\pi_\theta(\tau')R(\tau')}_{\nabla_\theta J_{post}(\tau,\tau')}\\\
&+\underbrace{\alpha\nabla_\theta\log\pi_\theta(\tau)R(\tau')}_{\nabla_\theta J^{II}_{pre}(\tau,\tau')}\Big]\Bigg]\tag{4}\label{eq:4}
\end{align}
$$

This distinction arises because $$P_{\mathcal T}(\tau\vert \theta)$$ appears in different places in formulas $$I$$ and $$II$$, and thus score function estimators are computed differently. The following figure shows the corresponding stochastic computation graphs with $$I$$ on the left and $$II$$ on the right. The red arrows depict how credit assignment w.r.t. the pre-update sampling distribution $$P_{\mathcal T}(\tau\vert \theta)$$ is propagated. Formulation $$I$$ propagates the credit assignment through the update step, thereby exploiting the full problem structure. In contrast, formulation $$II$$ neglects the inherent structure, directly assigning credit from post-update return $$R'$$ to the pre-update policy $$\pi_\theta$$ which leads to noisier, less effective credit assignment.

This figure also illustrate the change of relation between $$U$$ and $$(\mathcal T,\pi_\theta)$$. In formulation $$I$$, $$U$$ is a function directly depending on $$(\mathcal T,\pi_\theta)$$ through $$P_{\mathcal T}(\tau\vert \theta)$$. In contrast, formulation $$II$$ samples $$\tau$$ from $$P_{\mathcal T}(\tau\vert \theta)$$ first, then constructs $$U$$ from $$\tau$$, breaking the direct dependence between $$U$$ and $$(\mathcal T, \pi_\theta)$$. We refer readers unfamiliar with stochastic computation graphs to our [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-01-SCG %}).

In this section, we further study each terms formulations $$I$$ and $$II$$. First, we rewrite them as follows

$$
\begin{align}
{\nabla_\theta J_{post}(\tau,\tau')}&=\big(I+R(\tau)\alpha\nabla_\theta^2\log\pi_{\theta}(\tau)\big)\nabla_{\theta'}\log\pi_\theta(\tau')R(\tau')\\\
{\nabla_\theta J^I_{pre}(\tau,\tau')} &=\alpha\nabla_\theta\log\pi_\theta(\tau)\Big(\underbrace{(\nabla_\theta\log\pi_\theta R(\tau))^T}_{\nabla_\theta J^{inner}}\underbrace{(\nabla_{\theta'}\log\pi_{\theta'}(\tau')R(\tau')}_{\nabla_{\theta'} J^{outer}})\Big)\\\
{\nabla_\theta J^{II}_{pre}(\tau,\tau')}&=\alpha\nabla_\theta\log\pi_\theta(\tau)R(\tau')
\end{align}
$$

Taking a closer look at each term, we can see

- $$\nabla_\theta J_{post}(\tau,\tau')$$ is equal in both formulas. It simply corresponds to a policy gradient step on the post-update policy $$\pi_{\theta'}$$ w.r.t. $$\theta'$$, followed by a linear transformation from post- ($$\theta'$$) to pre-update parameters ($$\theta$$). This term increases the likelihood of the trajectories $$\tau'$$ that lead to higher returns, but it does not optimize for the pre-update sampling distribution, i.e., which trajectory $$\tau$$ leads to better adaptation steps.

- The credit assignment w.r.t. the pre-updated sampling distribution is carried out by the second term. $$\nabla_\theta J_{pre}^{II}$$ can be viewed as standard policy gradient on $$\pi_\theta$$ with $$R(\tau')$$ as reward signal, treating the update function $$U$$ as part of the unknown dynamics of the system. This shifts the pre-update sampling distribution so that higher post-update returns are achieved. However, this term omits the causal dependence of the post-update policy on the pre-update policy. This implies that increasing the impact of $$\pi_\theta$$ on $$R'$$ may weaken that of $$\pi_{\theta'}$$ on $$R'$$. The figure above demonstrates this difference.

- Formulation $$I$$ takes the causal dependence of $$P_{\mathcal T}(\tau'\vert \theta')$$ on $$P_{\mathcal T}(\tau\vert \theta)$$ into account. It does so by maximizing the inner product of pre-update and post-update policy gradient (see $$\nabla_\theta J_{pre}^I$$). This steers the pre-update policy towards 1) larger post-update returns(i.e., larger $$R(\tau')$$) 2) larger adaptation steps(i.e., larger $$\pi_{\theta'}$$) 3) better alignment of pre- and post-update policy gradients (i.e., larger $$(\nabla_\theta\log\pi_\theta)^T\nabla_{\theta'}\log\pi_{\theta'}$$)

## ProMP: Proximal Meta-Policy Search

In this section, we briefly discuss the potential problem of the original implementation of MAML-RL, and introduce ProMP, proposed by Rothfuss, Lee&Clavera et al., to address the issue. As for the detailed reasoning, please refer to the original paper; I'm going to take a rain check, J.

### Low Variance Curvature Estimator

Although MAML-RL proposed by Finn et al. is theoretically sound, the corresponding implementation neglects $$\nabla_\theta J^I_{pre}$$, resulting in highly biased estimate. To address this issue, Rothfuss, Lee&Clavera et al. introduce the low variance curvature(LVC) estimator:

$$
J^{LVC}(\tau)=\sum_{t=0}^{H-1}{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)\over\perp(\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t))}\left(\sum_{t'=t}^{H-1}r(s_{t'},a_{t'})\right)
$$

where $$\perp$$ denotes the "stop_gradient" operator. The second derivative of this estimator has lower variance than DiCE, proposed by Foerster et al[5], but makes the estimate biased. This bias of LVC estimator, under some conditions, becomes negligible close to local optima. The following figure shows LVC estimator experimentally improves the sample-efficiency of meta-learning by a significant margin compared to DiCE

The $$y$$ axes are mislabeled in the above figure. The graphs on the top have standard deviation as $$y$$-axis, while the graphs on the bottom have average return as $$y$$-axis.

### ProMP

ProMP uses PPO to ease the computational cost of TRPO. In particular, it defines post-update objective as follows

$$
\begin{align}
J^{ProMP}_{\mathcal T}(\theta)&=J_{\mathcal T}^{CLIP}(\theta')-\eta D_{KL}(\pi_{\theta_{o}},\pi_\theta)\\\
J_{\mathcal T}^{CLIP}&=\mathbb E_{\tau\sim P_{\mathcal T}(\tau|\theta)}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{H-1}\min \left({\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)\over\pi_{\theta_{o}(a_t|s_t)}}\hat A_t, \mathrm{clip}\left({\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)\over\pi_{\theta_{o}(a_t|s_t)}}, 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon\right)\hat A_t\right)\right]
\end{align}
$$

where $$\pi_{\theta_o}$$ is the original policy, which we do not compute gradient through, and $$\eta=0.005$$. The author further introduce the [KL term](https://github.com/jonasrothfuss/ProMP/blob/8d90732d1e1e85592ca3083c43c368b0eb0245e3/meta_policy_search/meta_algos/pro_mp.py#L101) in additional to the original PPO objective to bound changes in the pre-update state visitation distribution.

The pre-update objective modifies the LCV estimator a bit to account for changes in the pre-update action distribution $$\pi_\theta(a_t\vert s_t)$$

$$
J^{LR}_{\mathcal T}(\theta)=\mathbb E_{\tau\sim P_{\mathcal T}(\tau,\theta_o)}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{H-1}{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)\over\pi_{\theta_o}(a_t|s_t)}A^{\pi_{\theta_o}}(s_t,a_t)\right]
$$

The entire algorithm is described as follows
