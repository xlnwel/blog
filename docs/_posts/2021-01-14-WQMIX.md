## Introduction

In the previous post, we discussed that [QMIX]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-01-07-QMIX %}) combined all $$Q_a$$ via a mixing network with positive weights to produce the global $$Q_{tot}$$. In this post, we first show that some pitfalls of $$Q_{tot}$$ obtained in this way. Then we address these 

## Pitfalls of QMIX

For We define the QMIX operator $$\mathcal T^*_{QMIX}$$ 

$$
\begin{align}
\mathcal T_{Qmix}^*=\underset{q\in Q^{mix}}{\arg\min}\sum_{}
\end{align}
$$
