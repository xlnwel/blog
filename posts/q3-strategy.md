# Q3 Revenue Strategy

As we move into Q3, our focus shifts from user acquisition to **retention** and **LTV (Lifetime Value)** maximization. 

## Market Analysis

The current market volatility suggests a trend towards "essential" SaaS tools. Our churn rate has remained steady at 2%, but expansion revenue is lagging.

### Key Objectives

*   **Increase ARR by 15%**: Through upselling existing Enterprise tiers.
*   **Reduce CAC**: By optimizing our inbound content funnel (SEO).

## The Pivot

We observed that our "Pro" users were underutilizing the analytics dashboard. 

1.  **Feature Audit**: We identified friction points in the onboarding flow.
2.  **Pricing Model**: We are testing a usage-based component for heavy API users.

## Financial Projections

| Metric | Q2 Actual | Q3 Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1.2M | $1.4M |
| Churn | 2.1% | 1.8% |
| NPS | 45 | 50 |

## Conclusion

Execution speed is critical. The engineering team has aligned their sprint goals with these business outcomes to ensure we ship the new pricing capabilities by Week 4.
